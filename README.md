# ConsultED
FAQ chatbot designed to help secondary students better learn of their post-secondary options. Created using the Genesys API in Postman.
The frontend of the Chatbot is upheld using basic HTML and CSS styling, as well as eventListeners using JavaScript. JS is also used to incorporate the Genesys API.

## Note
Unfortunately, Genesys has discontinued the API that was used in the making of this chatbot, and as such, the chatbot will not function as intended.
